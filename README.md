LTRANS_Zlev is a new version of the off-line Lagrangian ocean particle-tracking model LTRANS that is compatible with a Z-coordinate (constant-depth layers) discretization of the hydrodynamic equations. 
LTRANS_Zlev is parallelized (OpenMP) and includes new features such as the backward-in-time particle-tracking and some new customizable larval behaviour options. It also includes the OILTRANS-module for oil spill simulations.
